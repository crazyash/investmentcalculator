            <p>A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a
                higher
                rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not
                require
                the creation of a separate account. It is known as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia,
                New
                Zealand, and the US, and as a bond in the United Kingdom and India.
                <br /><br /> For a fixed deposit is that the
                money
                cannot be withdrawn from the FD as compared to a recurring deposit or a demand deposit before maturity.
                Some
                banks may offer additional services to FD holders such as loans against FD certificates at competitive
                interest rates.
                <br /><br /> It's important to note that banks may offer lesser interest rates under uncertain
                economic
                conditions. The interest rate varies between 4 and 7.50 percent. The tenure of an FD can vary from 7, 15
                or 45 days to 1.5 years and can be as high as 10 years. These investments are safer than Post Office
                Schemes as they are covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).

                Deposit?</button>
        </div>

        <div id="recurring_deposit" class="tabcontent">
            <p>A recurring deposit is a special kind of term deposit offered by banks in India which help people with
                regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their recurring deposit account and earn
                interest
                at the rate applicable to fixed deposits. It is similar to making fixed deposits of a certain amount in
                monthly installments. This deposit matures on a specific date in the future along with all the deposits
                made
                every month. Recurring deposit schemes allow customers an opportunity to build up their savings through
                regular monthly deposits of a fixed sum over a fixed period of time. The minimum period of a recurring
                deposit is six months and the maximum is ten years.
                <br /><br />
                The recurring deposit can be funded by standing instructions which are the instructions by the customer
                to
                the bank to withdraw a certain sum of money from his savings/current account and debit to the recurring
                deposit account.
                <br /><br />
                When the recurring deposit account is opened, the maturity value is indicated to the customer assuming
                that
                the monthly installments will be paid regularly on due dates. If any installment is delayed, the
                interest
                payable in the account will be reduced and will not be sufficient to reach the maturity value.
                Therefore,
                the difference in interest will be deducted from the maturity value as a penalty. The rate of penalty
                will
                be fixed upfront. Interest is compounded on quarterly basis in recurring deposits.
                <br /><br />
                One can avail loans against the collateral of a recurring deposit up to 80 to 90% of the deposit value.

                Plan?</button>

        </div>
        <div id="sip" class="tabcontent">

            <p>A systematic investment plan (SIP) is an investment vehicle offered by mutual funds to investors,
                allowing
                them to invest small amounts periodically instead of lump sums. The frequency of investment is usually
                weekly, monthly or quarterly.
                <br /><br />
                In SIPs, a fixed amount of money is debited by the investors in bank accounts periodically and invested
                in a
                specified mutual fund. The investor is allocated a number of units according to the current Net asset
                value.
                Every time a sum is invested, more units are added to the investors account.
                <br /><br />
                The strategy claims to free the investors from speculating in volatile markets by dollar cost averaging.
                As
                the investor is getting more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high, in the
                long
                run, the average cost per unit is supposed to be lower.
                <br /><br />
                SIP claims to encourage disciplined investment. SIPs are flexible; the investors may stop investing a
                plan
                anytime or may choose to increase or decrease the investment amount. SIP is usually recommended to
                retail
                investors who do not have the resources to pursue the active investment.
